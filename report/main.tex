\section{Design}
The design for this multi-threaded recursive text search was based mostly on
provided code, but included heavy modification to prevent deadlocks.

\subsection{Header File}
All global instance, function, and type definitions were placed in the header
file~\ttt{work\_crew.h}, to improve the readability of the main source
file~\ttt{work\_crew.c}.
%
\hlst{1}{10}
%
These objects were declared globally, with the following intended meanings:
%
\begin{center}
\parbox{.85\textwidth}{
\begin{description}
	\item[MAX\_THREADS]{Maximum number of threads to possibly create.}
	\item[num\_threads]{Number of threads that have been spawned at any time.}
	\item[number\_sleeping]{Number of spawned threads that are currently sleeping.}
	\item[all\_done]{Boolean-like variable indicating if the entire origin directory has been searched.}
	\item[spawned]{Boolean-like variable indicating if other threads have been spawned yet.}
	\item[threads]{Pointer to array of type \ttt{pthread}, containing one element for each thread spawned.}
	\item[wake\_up]{Signal to wake threads up from sleeping.}
	\item[num\_sleeping]{Mutex protecting \ttt{number\_sleeping}.}
	\item[sleepers]{Pointer to array of mutexes protecting \ttt{number\_sleeping}.}
	\item[done]{Mutex protecting \ttt{all\_done}.}
\end{description}
}
\end{center}

In order to provide each thread with the appropriate information, a custom
datatype was created as shown below.
%
\hlst{12}{25}
%
Similar to previous assignments, the following pieces of information were
passed to each thread:
%
\begin{center}
\parbox{.85\textwidth}{
\begin{description}
	\item[threadID]{Integer identifier for the thread.  The first thread
	spawned will receive ID~0, and subsequent threads will receive~1,~2,
	$\ldots$ , \ttt{NUM\_THREADS} - 1.}
	\item[queue]{Pointer to the queue of files and directories to search.}
	\item[mutex\_queue]{Pointer to the mutex protecting the work queue.}
	\item[num\_occurrences]{Pointer to the integer representing the number of occurrences of the target string.}
	\item[mutex\_count]{Pointer to the mutex protecting~\ttt{num\_occurrences}.}
\end{description}
}
\end{center}
%
Additionally, a custom datatype was created to ease the process of generating
scriptable output.
%
\hlst{27}{34}
%
While these instance variables are fairly self-explanatory, they were created
with the following intended meanings:
%
\begin{center}
\parbox{.85\textwidth}{
\begin{description}
	\item[count]{The number of occurrences of the target string found by the returning function.}
	\item[time]{Amount of time required to execute the returning function.}
\end{description}
}
\end{center}

Finally, the non-main functions were declared:
%
\hlst{36}{39}
%
in which~\ttt{search\_for\_string\_serial} is the single-threaded
implementation,~\ttt{search\_for\_string\_mt} is the multi-threaded
implementation, and~\ttt{worker\_thread} is the function executed by each
thread.

\subsection{Main File}
\subsubsection{Main}
The main entry point for the search test is, as is expected, the~\ttt{main}
function, shown below.
%
\clst{24}{46}
%
The function first checks the command line arguments to ensure that it has
sufficient information to run~--- a string and a target directory.  If this
information is not provided, the usage syntax is printed to the screen and the
application exists.  Additionally, if the number of threads is not provided, it
defaults to eight.  Once this initial validation is complete, the single- and
multi-threaded implementations are executed, and a script-safe output in the
format of the following example:
%
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
		                    & Threads & Single & Multi & Match \\
		Scriptable output:  & 8   & 3.292550   & 3.163284 & true \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
%
This provides the number of threads, execution time for both the single- and
multi-threaded implementations, and whether or not the number of occurrences
for the two implementations matches in an easily-parsable format.  While this
was not a requirement for the assignment, it made the process of acquiring and
analyzing the resulting data much easier.

\subsubsection{Single-Threaded}
There were no appreciable changes made to the single-threaded implementation.
While the return type was changed to~\ttt{RET\_TYPE} and there were slight
modifications to the post-search code, the searching portions of the function
remained unmodified from the provided version.

\subsubsection{Multi-Threaded}
The multi-threaded approach to string search begins by allocating space for the
threads array and declaring and initializing the relevant mutexes.
%
\clst{194}{226}
%
Next, an array of mutexes for sleeping threads is created, as well as a series
of counters.  Finally, an instance of~\ttt{THREAD\_ARGS} is created and filled
with the appropriate values.

At this point in the execution, a timer is created and started, and an initial
thread is spawned.
%
\clst{228}{237}
%
After spawning the first thread, the multi-threaded control function simply
waits for all threads to return, at which point it stops the timer, calculates
the execution time, and prints its final search results and execution time.
%
\clst{239}{259}

\subsubsection{Worker Thread}
\paragraph{Setup}
Each thread begins simply by casting the arguments of~\ttt{worker\_thread} from
void~(as required by the pthread libraries) back to type~\ttt{THREAD\_ARGS}.
%
\clst{263}{271}
%
As in the single-threaded case, two queue elements are first declared as well
as the relevant objects for any directory information that will be encountered.

If the calling thread is the first one spawned~(i.e. with a \ttt{threadID} of
zero), the shared work queue is allocated and initialized.
%
\clst{274}{288}
%
While this could have also been performed before any threads were spawned, it
was included here in the interest of clarity.  Testing for the thread's ID
happens once per thread and requires only~$O(1)$ time, so this causes no
significant slowdown.

\paragraph{The Loop}
While the implementation of the searching algorithm required modifications in
order to prevent deadlocking and data corruption, its overall flow nd operation
remained largely unchanged.  For this reason, only the changes will be
discussed here.

Each thread begins by removing the first item of the queue.  Because all threads access
and modify the same queue, the mutex referenced by~\ttt{mutex\_queue} must be
locked prior to access and unlocked after in order to prevent conflicts.
%
\clst{291}{298}
%
While the single-threaded implementation tested the state of the queue in
the~\ttt{while} loop's condition, the test was moved to the first operation
inside the loop so that the queue could be properly protected by its mutexes.

The next change occurs when the end of a directory is reached, in which the
initial thread spawns its siblings.
%
\clst{329}{355}
%
Each thread tests its ID and whether or not the extra threads have been
spawned.  If it is thread zero and the sibling threads haven't been created~(as
indicated by the value of the~\ttt{spawned} variable), then an instance
of~\ttt{THREAD\_ARGS} is created and filled prior to each thread's creation.

For each new element reached by a thread, the queue must be locked and
subsequently unlocked in order to contribute to the work queue.
%
\clst{370}{383}
%
Once the newly constructed queue element has been added and the queue unlocked,
all remaining threads are woken up with an iterated call
to~\ttt{pthread\_cond\_signal}.  While~\ttt{pthread\_cond\_broadcast} should be
used to wake multiple threads that are waiting on one signal, it does not work
in this case~--- this is most likely caused by the fact that each thread locks
a different mutex prior to calling~\ttt{pthread\_cond\_wait}.

In the event that the queue is empty, a thread simply unlocks the queue's mutex
and locks the mutexes protecting the number of sleeping threads and the
completion status.
%
\clst{434}{445}
%
If the process is complete, the two mutexes are unlocked~(in the reverse order
of locking to prevent deadlocks) and the thread exits.  If the process is not
complete but the currently-executing thread is the only remaining thread awake,
it sets the completion status to true before unlocking the two previously
locked mutexes.
%
\clst{446}{457}
%
As it is the only thread not sleeping, the executing thread serially wakes the
remaining threads before exiting.

For the case that a thread is not the last one awake and the search process is
not complete, it~(safely) increments the number of sleeping threads.  It next
locks the mutex protecting its sleeping state and safely checks the completion
state to ensure that the search hasn't completed since its last check.  This
prevents a thread from entering an eternal sleep.
%
\clst{458}{486}
%
If the search still has not completed then the thread waits for
a~\ttt{wake\_up} signal, essentially putting it to sleep until another thread
wakes it.  Upon waking, a thread will either exit if the search is complete or
decrement the number of sleeping threads and continue from the beginning of the
loop once again.
